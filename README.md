Best practices at work for software engineers. 


- Always join Debugging/Incident calls. Even when it's not yours, especially when it's not yours, you can learn with low stress. While you may not be aware of the complete context, it's fine. You will learn how to respond better to such incidents

- When you face an issue and you/someone resolves it. Your next step is to build tooling around ensuring the same issue doesn't happen again. It creates good impact and visibility.
