Best practices at work for software engineers. 

- When you join a company, note down all the difficulties you face during your first month and you can work on tasks which improve the process for the new joinees

- While the business has its sprints and backlogs, You should have your backlog of tech which you planned to work on. Get your ideas reviewed with your peers and work on them with some % of time dedicated to it.

- Maintain a work log and update it weekly or bi-weekly. At one point in time, you should have the info for the question "What did you get done so far?". One upside of this doc is You don't have to spend more time writing the yearly self-review and with this doc, you have a better version than something which is written in a hurry. 

- Always join Debugging/Incident calls. Even when it's not yours, especially when it's not yours. You can learn with low stress. While you may not be aware of the complete context, it's fine. You will learn how to respond better to such incidents

- When you face an issue and you/someone resolves it. Your next step is to build tooling around ensuring the same issue doesn't happen again. It creates good impact and visibility.
